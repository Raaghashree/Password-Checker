### **Abstract**  
The **Password Complexity Tester** is a Python-based script designed to evaluate the strength of a given password. It checks for essential security criteria, including length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. By assigning a **strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong)** based on these factors, the tool helps users create more secure passwords, enhancing personal and organizational cybersecurity.

### **Description**  
This script analyzes a password against five key security factors:  
1. **Minimum Length (8+ characters)**  
2. **At least one Uppercase letter**  
3. **At least one Lowercase letter**  
4. **At least one Digit**  
5. **At least one Special Character (!@#$%^&* etc.)**  

The script assigns a score based on the number of criteria met and categorizes the password as **Weak (≤2 criteria met), Moderate (3-4), or Strong (5/5)**. It provides immediate feedback, making it a valuable tool for **individual users, developers, and organizations** to ensure password security. 🚀🔐
